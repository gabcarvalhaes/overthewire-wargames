The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames. **If you notice something essential is missing or have ideas for new levels, please let us know!**

## Note for beginners

This game, like most other games, is organised in levels. You start at Level 0 and try to “beat” or “finish” it. Finishing a level results in information on how to start the next level. The pages on this website for “Level <X>” contain information on how to start level X from the previous level. E.g. The page for [Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html) has information on how to gain access from [Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html) to [Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html). All levels in this game have a page on this website, and they are all linked to from the sidemenu on the left of this page.

You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you are supposed to do. **Don’t panic! Don’t give up!** The purpose of this game is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics, is reading a lot of new information. If you’ve never used the command line before, a good first read is this [introduction to user commands](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/intro.1.html).https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
