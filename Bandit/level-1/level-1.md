# level-1

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## Commands you may need to solve this level

[ls](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) , [cd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cd.1p.html) , [cat](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) , [file](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html) , [du](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/du.1.html) , [find](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)

Using the ls command, we can find a file named "readme". After that, we can use the command cat to see its content:

Then, we can login to the next level by login in the server again with the user bandit1:
